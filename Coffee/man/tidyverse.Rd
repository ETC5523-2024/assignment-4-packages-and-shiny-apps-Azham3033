\title{Prepare and Filter Coffee Survey Data}
\format{
The \code{coffee_filtered} dataset includes the following columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{Unique identifier for each respondent.}
\item{age}{Age group of the respondent as a factor with levels: \verb{<18 years old},
\verb{18-24 years old}, \verb{25-34 years old}, \verb{35-44 years old}, \verb{45-54 years old},
\verb{55-64 years old}, \verb{>65 years old}.}
\item{cups}{Number of cups of coffee consumed per day.}
\item{brew}{Preferred brew method.}
\item{gender}{Gender of the respondent, either "Male" or "Female".}
\item{purchase}{Type of coffee purchase (e.g., in-store or online).}
\item{total_spend}{Total amount spent on coffee in a month.}
\item{spent_equipment}{Amount spent on coffee brewing equipment.}
\item{favorite}{Favorite type of coffee.}
}
}
\source{
The data was collected from a coffee survey.
}
\description{
This script processes the raw coffee survey data by cleaning, filtering,
and restructuring it for analysis. The final dataset, \code{coffee_filtered},
contains only relevant columns and filters respondents to include only those who have
reported their gender as "Male" or "Female." The age column is converted into a factor
with ordered levels based on predefined age categories.
}
\details{
The raw data is first loaded from a CSV file (\code{coffee_survey.csv}) and a unique \code{id}
is added for each respondent. The relevant columns (\code{id}, \code{age}, \code{cups}, \code{brew}, \code{gender},
\code{purchase}, \code{total_spend}, \code{spent_equipment}, and \code{favorite}) are selected. The data is
then filtered to retain only respondents who have indicated their gender as "Male" or "Female."
The \code{age} column is converted into a factor with a predefined order for consistent analysis.

The processed dataset, \code{coffee_filtered}, is saved as an internal dataset using
the \code{usethis::use_data()} function, allowing it to be used within the package.
}
\examples{
# The processed dataset `coffee_filtered` is available in the package after running this code:
\dontrun{
coffee_data <- readr::read_csv("data-raw/coffee_survey.csv")

coffee_survey <- coffee_data \%>\% mutate(id = row_number())

coffee_survey_filtered <- coffee_survey \%>\%
  select(id, age, cups, brew, gender, purchase, total_spend, spent_equipment, favorite)

coffee_filtered <- coffee_survey_filtered \%>\%
  filter(gender \%in\% c("Male", "Female"))

age_order <- c("<18 years old", "18-24 years old", "25-34 years old", "35-44 years old",
               "45-54 years old", "55-64 years old", ">65 years old")

coffee_filtered$age <- factor(coffee_filtered$age, levels = age_order)

usethis::use_data(coffee_filtered, overwrite = TRUE)
}
