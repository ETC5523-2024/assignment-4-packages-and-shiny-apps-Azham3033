# Coffee

The **coffee** package provides tools and interactive features to analyze coffee consumption patterns based on survey data. This package includes a variety of functions for statistical analysis and an RShiny app to help users visualize coffee preferences by demographic factors, such as age group, gender, and favorite coffee type.

Explore coffee preferences interactively using the Shiny app included with this package, allowing you to filter data and view results in various visualizations tailored to your preferences.

You can view a comprehensive guide to this package on its [website]("https://etc5523-2024.github.io/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-Azham3033/index.html").

**NOTE**: When launching the RShiny app, there may be a short delay as the app loads the data. Please allow the app approximately 10-20 seconds to fully initialize, as it loads and processes the coffee survey dataset.
